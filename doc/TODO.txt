TODOs

* Auto-email the children at a set time, with program details and an opt-out link.
* Add an admin site with a hard-coded password allowing admins to modify the users table.
* Add a 'creator (varchar(20))' 'last_updater (ditto)', 'created (datetime not null)', 'last_updated (ditto)'
  to each table, and have each update fill them in.

BUGs

Basic-encoding sends the password out as base-64's plain text. Is that OK?
