Run the mysql server with:
DBDIR=~/Development/Databases
mysqld_safe --no-options --log-error=$DBDIR/mysql.err --datadir=$DBDIR/MySQL --socket=$DBDIR/socket

Shut it down with:
mysqladmin -u root -p --socket=$DBDIR/socket  -- shutdown

Use the local client with 
mysql -u paw -p --socket=$DBDIR/socket finances

Use a remote client with
mysql -u paw -p --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 finances




UNIX SOCKETS

You can run the mysqld as user paw as long as you specify a socket.
By default the mysqld is compiled to use a socket under /var/run which is only writeable as root.



NETWORK CONNECTIONS

The mysql server has default preferences to disable network connections and use only the unix socket.
These are in /opt/local/etc/mysql56/my.conf.

If you want network connection available (e.g. for jdbc connections) then pass --no-options as the first
entry on the command line. By default it will then use 127.0.0.1:3306 for the location.

Also note, use '127.0.0.1' not 'localhost', as localhost sometimes defaults to the unix socket automatically.
127.0.0.1 always uses TCP.




HINTS

The password for paw is my standard old password. The musical one.
The root password is my usual root password. The wild one.
